#cbecei_founders contains the script used to infer/phase C.becei founders haplotypes from RILs genotype data

#The FounderInRILS reprository contains scripts to infer known founder haplotype blocks within a RILs panel and to plot it. 
=>If you are using this scripts, please talk to me as there are some inference choice that should be discussed 
(typically, when the founder haplotypes are identical within a genomic intervals, one is chosen based on some criteria)
